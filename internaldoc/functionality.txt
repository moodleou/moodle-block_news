= News Block =

== Introduction ==

This document currently only contains functionality information about
selected features of the news block, not the whole news block feature.

== News block feed URLs ==

=== Description ===

A URL may be used to obtain the Atom feed of a single news block. This
can be the feed of either a specific news block or the uppermost news
block on a course page for a specific user.

To obtain the feed of a specific news block you add a URL parameter for
the block instance id, and optionally a URL parameter for any grouping
ids. Multiple grouping ids are separated by commas.

Examples
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?bi=32
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?bi=32&groupingsids=85
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?bi=32&groupingsids=85,125

If Enable message restriction is set to Group, the user's groups will
be get by username block instance id. The feed messages are restricted
by groups.

Examples
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?bi=32&username=fred1

To obtain the feed of the uppermost news block on a course page for a
specific user, you add a URL parameter for the username and one for the
course short name.

Example
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?shortname=NEWSBLOCK&username=fred1

== News block remote feeds ==

Remote feeds can be set up in the 'Feed URLs' setting of a news block. These will be updated
periodically. You can set a remote feed to another news block's feed, or to any public feed such as
BBC News.

NOTE: There should be more detail about remote feeds here but I am only documenting the feature
currently being added.

When remote feeds are updated, the system deletes from the database any existing messages which
have changed or been deleted, and then adds into the database any changed or added messages. For
example, if you have a feed with messages A, B, and C, and it then changes to have messages A, C*,
and D (where C* is a modified version of C), then messages B and C will be deleted, and C* and D
added. This results in the minimal number of changes in the database.

== Hide images ==

News block settings include a 'Hide images' option. (This is forced to Yes for subject websites.)

When enabled, images added to the 'Image' section when posting a news item do not appear in the
block, or on the 'View all messages' page. (These are the cases when it would normally display
a thumbnail version of the image.)

The full-size 700x330 image does still appear when viewing a single news message, so you can still
set the image when posting a news item.
