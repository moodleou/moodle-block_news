the news feed feature of the news block at present, not the
functionality of the whole news block feature.


== News block feed ==

=== Description ===

A URL may be used to obtain the Atom feed of a single news block. This
can be the feed of either a specific news block or the uppermost news
block on a course page for a specific user.

To obtain the feed of a specific news block you add a URL parameter for
the block instance id, and optionally a URL parameter for any grouping
ids. Multiple grouping ids are separated by commas.

Examples
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?bi=32
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?bi=32&groupingsids=85
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?bi=32&groupingsids=85,125

To obtain the feed of the uppermost news block on a course page for a
specific user, you add a URL parameter for the username and one for the
course short name.

Example
http://www.someserver.org/blocks/news/feed.php?shortname=NEWSBLOCK&username=fred1
