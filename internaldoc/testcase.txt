This file contains a sequence of test cases for the modified news feed
feature that now allows the user of a course short name in the URL
instead of the news feed block instance id.

Each single section is independent so that tests can be completed
without the need to do all of them. The exception is the first section;
you need to complete the first section in order to have the news feeds
in place that other parts of the test require.

Each section has a unique (within this test case) three letter code and
the steps are numbered so that the location where a failure occurs can
be reported.

Steps are shown in the following format:

XXX01 / U.S1 [change]
  Do something
  - Check something

If you are required to be logged in the unique step number is followed
by the user that you should be logged in as for that step. If the user
changes from the previous step, the word [Change] will be noted.

Some steps don't have specific items to check. In that case, the check
'passes' if there are no errors or warnings while completing the task.


Initial setup
=============

Please set up a standard test course with a course short name of
FEEDTEST

Create two users with a username of user1 and user2. Enrol them both onto
the FEEDTEST course.

Note: The testing of the news feed itself needs to be carried out in a
browser that is not logged in to your Moodle test server. Therefore it will
probaly be best to have two browsers open, one logged in to the test
server as admin and the other not logged in to the test server at all.


CRG Creating groups
===================

CRG01 / admin
  From the FEEDTEST course page create a new group. Set the group name to
  Group1 and leave the the other setting as default.
  Add user1 to this group.

CRG02 / admin
  Create a new grouping. Set the grouping name to Grouping1 and leave the
  other settings as default.
  Add the group Group1 to this grouping.


CRN Creating News blocks
========================

CRN01 / admin
  Create a News block with a Block title of NFeed1. Set Grouping
  support to 'Yes' and leave all other settings as default.
  Move NFeed1 to the right hand column.

CRN02 / admin
  Add a news item to news feed NFeed1 with the title NItem1.1 and 'News'
  in the Text field.
  Set Grouping to 'Grouping1' and leave all other settings as default.

CRN03 / admin
  Create a second News block with a Block title of NFeed2. Leave all
  other settings as default.
  Move NFeed2 to the right hand column.

CRN04 / admin
  Add a news item to news feed NFeed2 with the title NItem2.1 and 'News'
  in the Text field.
