News block
==========

Copyright 2013 The Open University


This is a news block that you can install into standard Moodle. 

It does not replace the existing 'Latest news' feature. To use this block, you
should simply add it to the course and remove the existing course.

This block has the following features:

* Independent: not linked to a forum, has its own interface.
* You can have multiple blocks per page.
* Add posts manually, or use RSS/Atom feeds to include posts from elsewhere,
  or both.
* Provides RSS/Atom format feed output - you can chain blocks together to
  repeat the same news on multiple sites. 
* Add posts that only appear at specific date. If restoring to a new course
  to create a 'new presentation' of the same course for next year, these dated
  posts (only) will be automatically updated so you can repeat the standard
  messages next time.
* Set posts that only appear to specific groupings.
